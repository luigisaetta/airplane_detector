# Airplane Detector
This repository contains all the work done to develop a solution to **detect and track airplanes** in video

The model trained is based on **Ultralytics YOLO V8**

## Training
The [script train_airplane.sh](./train_airplane.sh) can be used to train a YOLO V8 model.

## Training and validation dataset
As an example of dataset that can be used see: [Airplane Detection Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/luigi-saetta/airplanedetector)
